# 0x09. C# - Linear Algebra

## Background Context
This project is an introduction to linear algebra and its concepts. Linear algebra is essential to computer graphics and will give you a better understanding of what’s going on under the hood of game and graphics engines.

## Requirements
## .txt Answers
* All your files should end with a new line
* If the answer ends in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
* Vectors and matrices should be formatted with parentheses and commas as shown below:
Vector:
````
(0, 0.03)
````
Matrix:
````
(1, 0, -7.64)
(-9.41, -0.23, 7)
````
### C# Projects

### C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: ``Visual Studio Code``.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using ``dotnet``.
* A ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All default C# files named ``Program.cs`` should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
* You do not need to push your ``obj/`` or ``bin/`` folders.
* In the following tasks, there are no main files. For each C# task, you can use the variables in the related task prior to it to create your own main files for testing
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
* You are not allowed to use the ``Vector`` or ``Matrix`` classes in this project
* You can use the ``Math`` class in this project
* If the task’s return value can end in a decimal, round it to the nearest hundredth
