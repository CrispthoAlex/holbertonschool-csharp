# 0x08. C# - Inheritance

# Resources
#### Read or watch:

* Inheritance in C#
* Inheritance
* C# Inheritance
* Type Checking: ‚ÄúTypeOf()‚Äù, ‚Äú.GetType()‚Äù, or ‚Äúis‚Äù?
* Knowing When to Use Override and New Keywords


## Learning Objectives

## General

* What is inheritance
* How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
* What is a base class
* What is a derived class
* How to create a derived class
* How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
* What is the difference between the override and new modifiers
* What are is, .GetType(), TypeOf(), .IsInstanceOfType(), and .IsSubclassOf() and when to use them

## Requirements
### C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: ``Visual Studio Code``.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using ``dotnet``.
* A ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All default C# files named ``Program.cs`` should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
* You do not need to push your ``obj/`` or ``bin/`` folders.
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don‚Äôt have to push them to your repo (if you do we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
* All your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
* All your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags
