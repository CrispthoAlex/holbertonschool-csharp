0x05. C# - Structs, Enumerations

# Resources
#### Read or watch:

* Classes and Structs
* Using Structs
* Enumeration types
* .toString() method
* How to Override the .ToString() method
* struct (C# Reference)


## Learning Objectives

## General
* What is a struct
* What is a constructor
* What is a field
* What is a property
* What is an enumeration and when to use them
* What does toString do and how to override it

## Requirements
### C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: ``Visual Studio Code``.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using ``dotnet``.
* A ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All default C# files named ``Program.cs`` should be renamed to the name given in each task
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
* You do not need to push your ``obj/`` or ``bin/`` folders.
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples.

### Tasks

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
