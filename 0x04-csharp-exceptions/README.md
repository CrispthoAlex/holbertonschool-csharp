## Learning Objectives

## General
* What are exceptions and when to use them
* What is the purpose of catching exceptions
* How to handle exceptions
* How to use try, catch, finally
* How to raise built-in exceptions
* When to implement clean-up actions after exceptions

## Requirements
### C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet.
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project.
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct.
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders.
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
